Im the oldest of 3, and the oldest of 20 cousins (all under 13) in my super loving and extremely social family. So looking after kids has always been a given rather than a choice... until now! Thankfully i find it so fulfilling. Nannying is my ideal job as entertaining and supervising kids is my normal! I have previous babysitting experience, sport coaching experience as well as extensive tutoring experience with primary and lower high school students. I'm super close with my brother and sister, and am really looking forward to becoming a helping hand for you guys and a loving addition to the family. Im extremely happy to do housework, run errands, cook etc and would be thrilled to help with homework, play games and do absolutely anything creative. I am a comfortable and responsible driver on my P1 license. I have previous references i can provide if its preferred. Look forward to hearing from you!"
